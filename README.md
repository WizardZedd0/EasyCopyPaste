#   Auto Copy:
       Automatically copies text that:
           -is highlighted by dragging the mouse
           -Double Click
           -Triple Click
           -Ctrl+A - WARNING, was not designed with large clipboards in mind. Feel Free to comment out
                       this hotkey if you like.
           -SHIFT
       NOTE: Copies by using CTRL+C
#   Pastes:
       LBUTTON + RBUTTON pastes the text where the cursor is at.
       NOTE: Pastes by using CTRL+V
#   Miscellaneous:
      MBUTTON:: DELETE
      XBUTTON1:: UNDO (CTRL+Z)
      XBUTTON2:: REDO (CTRL+R)
      Due to the nature of the setup, replacement is also easy 
       (IE. Select text to copy, while holding left button select text to replace and push right button.)
   Very nice for mouse, especially those with XButtons. Not so nice for laptops.
   Uses the clipboard as a transfer point, but only temporarily. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V may be used normally.
